1. Write a query to display the last name and hire date of any employee in the same
   department as Zlotkey. Exclude Zlotkey.

    SELECT e.last_name, e.hire_date
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employees e2 ON e.department_id = e2.department_id
    WHERE e2.last_name = :user_last_name AND e.last_name != :user_last_name;

2. Create a query to display the employee numbers and last names of all employees who earn more
   than the average salary. Sort the results in ascending order of salary.

    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)
    ORDER BY salary ASC;

3. Write a query that displays the employee numbers and last names of all employees who work in a
   department with any employee whose last name contains a u. Place your SQL statement in a text
   file named lab6_3.sql. Run your query.

    SELECT employee_id, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id IN (
        SELECT department_id
        FROM employees
        WHERE last_name LIKE '%u%'
    );

4. Display the last name, department number, and job ID of all employees whose department location
   ID is 1700.

    SELECT last_name, department_id, job_id
    FROM employees

        SELECT department_id
        FROM departments
        WHERE location_id = 1700
    );

5. Display the last name and salary of every employee who reports to King.

        SELECT department_id
        FROM departments
        WHERE department_name = 'Executive'
    );

7. Modify the query in lab6_3.sql to display the employee numbers, last names, and salaries of
   all employees who earn more than the average salary and who work in a department with any
   employee with a u in their name. Resave lab6_3.sql to lab6_7.sql. Run the statement in
   lab6_7.sql.

    SELECT e.employee_id, e.last_name, e.salary
    FROM employees e
    WHERE e.department_id IN (
        SELECT department_id
        FROM employees
        WHERE last_name LIKE '%u%'
    )
    AND e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
